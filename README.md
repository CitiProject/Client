Travelling to new places can be an exciting yet challenging and expensive experience. A typical tour guide will only show visitors the main landmarks of an area. Our application will enable travellers to connect with locals, and for the locals to give experiences as only a local could. It would connect travellers with locals who have knowledge of the hidden gems of the area and know it inside and out. Thus, instead of being the typical clichéd tourist engaging in stereotypical activities, the users get to experience the destination like a true local. 

##Background Information
Touring is fun and exciting in general, but it could be tiring and challenging as well if the tourists are not familiar with the area they are exploring. It could be very helpful for some tourists to be connected with locals, who have knowledge of the area that cannot be learned through the internet. There is no existing application on the market that allows tourists to get connected with the locals of the touring destination. Our application enables the tourists to go out and socialize with the locals, find out delicious cultural cuisine, get invited to private parties, and have intriguing conversations with interesting people!

The tour guide will make money by charging an hourly fee for “meet-ups”. The rates would be set by the tour guides themselves. For instance to go out and show someone the nightlife of Madrid would be more of an expense then rather telling them of a cool hangout spot or dropping them off. Transactions would be processed through the application. The app would make money be taking a cut from the transactions between the tourists and tour guides.

The target market for the app are people on vacation or that are unfamiliar with the area. The idea is to improve the user experience of visiting new places. The app will be available for iOS. Anyone that can download the app is a potential customer.
